Design a minimal Attendance Management System using REST APIs.
The system supports students and teachers with role-based access control.

GENERAL CONSTRAINTS
- Architecture: RESTful API (JSON)
- Authentication: Token-based (JWT or equivalent)
- Roles: STUDENT, TEACHER
- Secure password hashing
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Input validation and error handling
- Role-based authorization on all endpoints

MODULES & API RESPONSIBILITIES

1. AUTHENTICATION
- Login users and issue access tokens
- Register new users with role assignment

Endpoints:
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/register

2. STUDENT DASHBOARD
- View daily and historical attendance
- Attendance summary and percentage

Endpoints:
- GET /student/attendance/summary
- GET /student/attendance/history

3. ATTENDANCE MARKING (STUDENT)
- Mark attendance once per day
- Prevent duplicate entries

Endpoints:
- POST /student/attendance/mark

4. TEACHER DASHBOARD
- View attendance overview
- Filter by date or student

Endpoints:
- GET /teacher/dashboard
- GET /teacher/attendance

5. ATTENDANCE RECORD MANAGEMENT (TEACHER)
- View and update attendance records if permitted

Endpoints:
- PUT /teacher/attendance/{attendanceId}

6. PROFILE MANAGEMENT
- Fetch and update user profile details

Endpoints:
- GET /user/profile
- PUT /user/profile

DATA MODELS (MINIMAL)

User:
- id
- name
- email
- password_hash
- role

Attendance:
- id
- student_id
- date
- status
- marked_at

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- Authorization middleware on all protected routes
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Timezone-aware date handling
