Features: [
  "Browse a menu of available cakes",
  "Customize cakes with different flavors, designs, and messages",
  "Specify pickup or delivery options",
  "Make payments online (using a dummy payment gateway for now)",
  "Create an account or login to view order history",
  "Integration with the restaurant's existing POS system and inventory management"
