  ✗ Found indentation in C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\Codes\POME\Top down\backend\app.py

  Attempting to fix: indentation error in C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\Codes\POME\Top down\backend\app.py

  Reasoning: **Error Analysis**

1. **Error Type**: The error type is an `IndentationError`, which is a type of syntax error in Python.
2. **Most Likely Cause**: The most likely cause of this error is that there is an **unexpected indentation** on line 346 of the `app.py` file. This means that the line of code i...

  Steps to fix:
  Here are the steps to completely solve the `IndentationError` bug:

1. **FILESYSTEM**: Open the file `app.py` located in the directory `C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\Codes\POME\Top down\backend`.
2. **MODIFY_FILE**: Go to line 346 in the `app.py` file and check the indentation level of the line `endpoints_list.append({"method": "PUT", "path": "/api/pos/override", "description": "Override POS System Data"}...
