ITERATIVE APPLICATION DESIGN WORKFLOW
======================================================================

Description: A Student Attendance Management System that allows students to mark their daily attendance 
and teachers to view and manage attendance records. The system includes user authentication 
with separate roles for students and teachers, profile management, and password recovery features.
Students can log in to mark their attendance daily, while teachers can view attendance records 
and track student attendance patterns. The system provides a clean, intuitive interface for 
both user types.

Features: [
  "User authentication with role-based access (student/teacher)",
  "Student daily attendance marking",
  "Teacher attendance record viewing",
  "User registration for students and teachers",
  "Password recovery functionality",
  "User profile management",
  "Dashboard views for both students and teachers",
  "Attendance history and records"
]
